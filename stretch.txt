#A Merge Conflict Is: 
    <> when you merge branches that have competing commits, 
        and Git needs your help to decide which changes to incorporate in the final merge.


#These Git Commands Do: 

    <> Pull 
        Is used to fetch and download content from a remote repository and immediately update the local repository to match that content. 

    <> Rebase
        Integrates changes from one branch into another. It is an alternative to the better known "merge" command. 

    <> Merge
        Git's way of putting a forked history back together again. 
        The git merge command lets you take the independent lines of development created by git branch and integrate them into a single branch. 
    
    //  

    <> Reset
        A powerful command that is used to undo local changes to the state of a Git repo.

    <> Revert
        A forward-moving undo operation that offers a safe method of undoing changes. 
        Instead of deleting or orphaning commits in the commit history, a revert will create a new commit that inverses the changes specified.

    <> Clean
        To some extent an 'undo' command. Git clean can be considered complementary to other commands like git reset and git checkout.
